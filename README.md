basic HTML pages that we can create:

Home page: This will display a welcome message and have links to different sections of the website.

Upload page: This page will allow users to upload their MP3 files and enter metadata such as title, artist, and album.

View all songs page: This page will display a table of all the songs in the system, including their title, artist, and album.

Search page: This page will allow users to search for songs by title, artist, or album.

Song page: This page will display information about a specific song, including the title, artist, album, and a player to stream the song. It will also have a download button for users to download the song.
